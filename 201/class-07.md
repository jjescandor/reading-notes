## Domain modeling

* Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. 
* A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.
* An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.
