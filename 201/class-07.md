## Domain modeling

* Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. 
* A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.
* An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

## Tables

A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data). A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data such as
* a person and their age
* a day of the week
* the timetable for a local swimming pool.

Using tables for layout rather than CSS layout techniques is a bad idea

Table structure: 
 ```
<td>Hi, I'm your first cell.</td>
<td>I'm your second cell.</td>
<td>I'm your third cell.</td>
<td>I'm your fourth cell.</td>
```
