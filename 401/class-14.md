matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats. We are going to explore matplotlib in interactive mode covering most common cases.
IPythonLinks to an external site. is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands, improved debugging and much more.
It allows interactive matplotlib sessions that have Matlab/Mathematica-like functionality.
pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library. It is modeled closely after Matlab(TM).
Therefore, the majority of plotting commands in pyplot have Matlab(TM) analogs with similar arguments. Important commands are explained with interactive examples.
In this section, we want to draw the cosine and sine functions on the same plot.
Starting from the default settings, we'll enrich the figure step by step to make it nicer.
