### Code of Ethics
- Computing professionals' actions change the world. To act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider impacts of their work, consistently supporting the public good.
- The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ("the Code") expresses the conscience of the profession.
- The Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students, influencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way.
- Additionally, the Code serves as a basis for remediation when violations occur. The Code includes principles formulated as statements of responsibility, based on the understanding that the public good is always the primary consideration.
- Each principle is supplemented by guidelines, which provide explanations to assist computing professionals in understanding and applying the principle.

### Ethics in Tech
- Companies have to learn to be responsible stewards of the artificial intelligence (AI) they deploy, the 5G networks they have begun to build, and so much more that’s coming toward us, from quantum computing to virtual reality (VR) to blockchain.
- Technologies that are driving sweeping change, and are central to the growth of the economy, should be trustworthy.
- Companies that deliver technological advances need to act ethically.
- The stakes are high. And yet, knowing what needs to be done is not the same as knowing how.
- Organizations should try to anticipate and address the potential effects of the technologies they deploy.
- While they can’t predict the future, they can adopt a sound framework that will help them prepare for and respond to unexpected impacts.
