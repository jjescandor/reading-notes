Tree

Tree data structures are built using tree nodes (a variation on the nodes you created earlier) and are another way of storing information.
Specifically, trees are used for data that has a hierarchical structure, such as a family tree or a computerâ€™s file system.
The tree data structure you are going to create is an excellent foundation for further variations on trees, including AVL trees, red-black trees, and binary search trees!
Root  - the top node in a tree

Child - a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root

Parent - the converse notion of a child

Siblings - a group of nodes with the same parent.
