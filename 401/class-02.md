Recursion

The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.
Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.
Test Driven Development (TDD)

programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing unit tests (Links to an external site.)) and design (in the form of refactoring (Links to an external site.)).
write a “single” unit test describing an aspect of the program
run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature
write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass
“refactor” the code until it conforms to the simplicity criteria (Links to an external site.) (Links to an external site.)
repeat, “accumulating” unit tests over time
If __name__ == "__main__"

Before executing code, Python interpreter reads source file and define few special variables/global variables.
If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value “__main__”.
If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name.
Module’s name is available as value to __name__ global variable.
