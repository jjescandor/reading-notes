In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__.
As it quickly became tiresome to say under-under-method-under-under Pythonistas adopted the term “dunder methods”, a short form of “double under.”
These “dunders” or “special methods” in Python are also sometimes called “magic methods.” But using this terminology can make them seem more complicated than they really are—at the end of the day there’s nothing “magical” about them.
Probability

At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?”

An event is some outcome of interest.

To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur.

The quintessential representation of probability is the humble coin toss.

In a coin toss the only events that can happen are:

Flipping a heads
Flipping a tails
