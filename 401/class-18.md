1. Encryption/Decryption and Cracking 

One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies.
The Vigenère cipheris a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution.[
First described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in 1553, the cipher is easy to understand and implement, but it resisted all attempts to break it until 1863, three centuries later.
This earned it the description le chiffrage indéchiffrable (French for 'the indecipherable cipher').
Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigenère ciphers. In 1863, Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a general method of deciphering Vigenère ciphers.

1. Cryptography

Cryptography, or the art and science of encrypting sensitive information, was once exclusive to the realms of government, academia, and the military.
However, with recent technological advancements, cryptography has begun to permeate all facets of everyday life.
Everything from your smartphone to your banking relies heavily on cryptography to keep your information safe and your livelihood secure.
And unfortunately, due to the inherent complexities of cryptography, many people assume that this is a topic better left to black hat hackers, multi-billion dollar conglomerates, and the NSA.
