### OSS Contribution
- Contributing to open source for the first time can be scary and a little overwhelming. 
- First contributions is a hands-on tutorial that walks you through contributions workflow on GitHub. When you complete the tutorial, you have made a contribution to the same project.
- https://up-for-grabs.net is a site that aggregates (rolls up and makes easy to explore) projects that actively want help. They label those projects with things like “up-for-grabs”, “jump-in” or “help wanted.”
- goodfirstissues.com is a site that aggregates the latest issues with the label “Good First Issue”, which is a GitHub feature for finding easy issues to tackle (see here). goodfirstissues.com empowers first-time contributors to find and select issues that they want to solve.
- goodfirstissue.dev curates easy pickings from popular open-source projects, and helps you make your first contribution to open-source.
- CodeTriage helps you subscribe to your favorite open-source projects and get a new open issue from them in your inbox every day.

### How to make OSS Contribution 
-  Identify your skills and interests
    - Take a pen and paper, write down your skills in terms of languages, frameworks or libraries that you’re most confident and comfortable with. This activity is more like a self-awareness kind of thing but it helps one identify the key(relevant) skills needed for contribution.
-  Choose a project and issue to work on
    - You can directly search for a project(s) or issue(s) on Github. Search for your favorite library or language that you have used in the past or some issue that you want to fix while learning.
-  Read the documentation of the repo
Focus on reading the documentation, especially the below two file(s), if they are present:
    - README.md
    - CONTRIBUTING.md
- Fork the repo
-   - This is straightforward. Just log in to your Github account, open the repo that you want to fork, click the fork button(top right).
