Web Scraping

Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort. 
Web scraping software may directly access the World Wide WebLinks to an external site. using the Hypertext Transfer ProtocolLinks to an external site. or a web browser.
While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a botLinks to an external site. or web crawlerLinks to an external site..
It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local databaseLinks to an external site. or spreadsheet, for later retrievalLinks to an external site. or analysisLinks to an external site..
If a crawler performs multiple requests per second and downloads large files, an under-powered server would have a hard time keeping up with requests from multiple crawlers.
Since web crawlersLinks to an external site., scrapers or spiders (words used interchangeably) donâ€™t really drive human website traffic and seemingly affect the performance of the site, some site administrators do not like spiders and try to block their access.
