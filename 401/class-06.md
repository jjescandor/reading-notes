Random Module
- This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.
- For integers, there is uniform selection from a range. For sequences, there is uniform selection of a random element, a function to generate a random permutation of a list in-place, and a function for random sampling without replacement.
- Class Random can also be subclassed if you want to use a different basic generator of your own devising: in that case, override the random(), seed(), getstate(), and setstate() methods. Optionally, a new generator can supply a getrandbits() method â€” this allows randrange() to produce selections over an arbitrarily large range.
What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?
- Risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done.
-The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.
TestCoverage
- Test coverage is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase.
- Test coverage is of little use as a numeric statement of how good your tests are.
