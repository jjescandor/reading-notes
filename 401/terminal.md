### The Command Line
1. A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. 
1. Users are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard.
1. Commands can be executed one at a time by typing the command and pressing Enter.
1. They can also be executed as a group, in which case the commands are typed into a "batch" or "script" file.
1. The file name is typed on the command line, and pressing Enter causes each command to be executed in order. 

### Basic Navigation
1. pwd(print working directory) - it tells uers what the current or present working directory is
1. ls - it tells users the current location (folder name)
1. cd(change directory) - move to another directory
1. Paths
    1. Relative path - A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
    1. Absolute path - file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.


### Files
1. If you type cd and press the Return key—with no directory specified—you’ll go back to your Home folder. (You can also type cd ~ to go there.)
1. If you type cd /, you’ll go to the root level of your startup disk.
1. If you type cd .. (that’s two periods), you’ll go to the directory above the one you’re currently in. So if you’re in your home folder, and type cd .., you’ll go to your Mac’s /Users folder.
1. And if you type cd - (hyphen) you’ll go back to the directory you were in before the last time you issued the cd command.

### Pages
1. The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do.
1. It also explains the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept. 

### File Manipulation

1. Linux organises it's file system in a hierarchical way.
1. Over time you'll tend to build up a fair amount of data (storage capacities are always increasing).
1. It's important that we create a directory structure that will help us organise that data in a manageable way.
